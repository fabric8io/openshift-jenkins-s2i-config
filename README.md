# openshift-jenkins-s2i-config

The Jenkins image for OISO Tenants and https://jenkins.cd.test.fabric8.io.

## Update plugins
we broke the plugin update after changes due to https://github.com/openshiftio/openshift.io/issues/2612
Hence introduce new way to update plugins.
1. Once you modified plugin.txt or added any .jpi/hpi in plugins folder
2. Please run the script update-version.sh, it will just update the version.txt to next increamental number.
3. git add version.txt
4. commit this change with the PR required for upating the plugin

## Prerequisites
  - Get the latest [s2i](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/releases)
  - Run the following in the default namespace as explained in the todo below

## Run

Run the following steps to build and deploy this customised OpenShift Jenkins
Pipeline image..

    # modify the existing OpenShift Jenkins image adding Pipeline plugins and configuration
    s2i build https://github.com/fabric8io/openshift-jenkins-s2i-config.git openshift/jenkins-1-centos7 fabric8/jenkins-openshift-pipeline:latest

    oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rawlingsj/openshift-jenkins-s2i-config/master/jenkins-template.yml -p JENKINS_PASSWORD=admin

    # expose the Jenkins service as you would normally e.g.
    oc expose service jenkins --hostname=jenkins.vagrant.f8

Access Jenkins via your OpenShift route, `admin/admin` to log in.

You will have an example pipeline job already created that you can run.  Also the configuration for kubernetes-plugin will have been setup automatically.  You can see in the Job configuration which it references a [Jenkinsfile in another repo](https://github.com/rawlingsj/basic-jenkinsfile), this is the recommended approach where a Jenkinsfile lives with the source code.  The Jenkinsfile uses the `agent` node label which requests a new Kubernetes Pod to be scheduled to run our basic stages.

Example basic Jenkinsfile..

    node('agent'){
      stage 'first'
      echo 'worked'

      stage 'second'
      echo 'again'
    }


## List of plugin installed

### Required:
1. [Pipeline plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin)
ability to run Jenkinsfile

2. [Pipeine stage view plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Stage+View+Plugin)
useful visualisations

3. [Kubernetes plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin)
dynamically create Jenkins Agents on demand

4. [Remote loader](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Remote+Loader+Plugin)
allows loading Pipeline scripts from remote locations.  Note until global library is versioned this is what we're suggesting users use to ensure reusable functions are versioned.

### Optional but recommend:
1. [Pipeline Utility Steps Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Utility+Steps+Plugin)
useful library for working with Jenkinsfiles

2. [Mercurial](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Mercurial+Plugin)
to support mercurial but we've not tested this

### Optional but not recommended
1. [Github branch source plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+GitHub+Branch+Source+Plugin)
still not too sure about this one, it sounds good but its usability is a little raw.  For example, it will automatically trigger any new job that gets created after a repo scan which is a little scary.

2. [Simple build pipeline](https://github.com/jenkinsci/simple-build-for-pipeline-plugin)
it didn't work for me but it looks promising in the future

## How to update plugins

It is really hard to update plugins correctly, you can get backward compatibility problems really easy.

First run (probably it is already deployed in OpenShift) the Jenkins instance you want to update from.
Go to _Manage Jenkins_, _Manage Plugins_ and update the plugins you need for next version.

After Jenkins is updated and you restart it, go to _Manage Jenkins_, _Script Console_ and run next script:

```groovy
Jenkins.instance.pluginManager.plugins.each{
  plugin ->
    println ("${plugin.getShortName()}:${plugin.getVersion()}")
}
```

Then just inspect the result and update the `plugins.txt` file properly.

## Add/Update plugins configuration

- Update [jenkins tenant configmap](https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant-jenkins/blob/master/apps/jenkins/src/main/fabric8/openshift-cm.yml) to add new  or update existing plugin configuration

## Note
You'll need to [expose the Jenkins JNLP port](https://github.com/rawlingsj/openshift-jenkins-s2i-config/blob/master/configuration/config.xml#L80) and create a separate agent service like [this example](https://github.com/rawlingsj/openshift-jenkins-s2i-config/blob/master/jenkins-template.yml#L26-L43)

## TODO
1. This example is currently hard coded to run in the default namespace at the moment.  I had a go at using a `KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE` env var as per the [fabric8 version](https://github.com/fabric8io/jenkins-docker/blob/master/config/config.xml#L159) which is [set](https://github.com/rawlingsj/openshift-jenkins-s2i-config/blob/master/jenkins-template.yml#L65) and available in the container but I ran into an issue starting the agent pod, so it needs to be looked at again.
2. Add the SNAPSHOT [openshift-jenkins-sync-plugin](https://github.com/fabric8io/openshift-jenkins-sync-plugin) to this project
